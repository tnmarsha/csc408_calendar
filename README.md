##General Usage Notes
### Using images on your pages
To use images in your page we will use random images.

This is a site that provides random images: https://picsum.photos/ and it explains how to build the URL

To use a photo reference an image with this format (where id will be the id of the user for example):

https://picsum.photos/id/1/100/100

Note that the pictures will not necessarily be pictures of people.


### Check the web.php routes file to see what has been defined

NOTE: I did not make any pretty front-end for this application.  Both routes just dump data to
the screen which is all you need for this project since it isn't a Laravel project.

yoururl.com/users

yoururl.com/meetings
